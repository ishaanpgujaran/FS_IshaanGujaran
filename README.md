## Problem Statement
Daily student commutes are often unorganized, unsafe, and inefficient. Many students rely on public transport, private cabs, or riding alone, which leads to:
- High travel costs  
- Unpredictable travel times  
- Safety concerns, especially for late-night travel  
- Lack of sustainable, eco-friendly ride-sharing options

## Existing Solutions & Their Gaps
- **Generic ride-sharing apps (Ola, Uber, Rapido)**  
  - Not tailored for student communities  
  - Expensive for daily use  
  - Lack features like trusted co-riders, college-based grouping  

- **College WhatsApp/Telegram groups**  
  - Unorganized, hard to track rides  
  - No real-time matching of routes  
  - No safety verification
